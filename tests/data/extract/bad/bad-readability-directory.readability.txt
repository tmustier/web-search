Incident Postmortem: Queue Lag on 2026-01-05
On Jan 5, a misconfigured retry policy caused queue lag spikes for
          about 32 minutes. We paused worker pools, drained the backlog, and
          reprocessed delayed jobs.
What happened
A newly deployed workflow increased retries from 3 to 15. The queue
          service auto-scaled, but throttling caused delays in downstream systems.
Fix
We reverted the change, capped retries, and added alerting for retry
          spikes. We also added a dashboard for queue latency percentiles.
Takeaways
Retry policies should be reviewed with SRE.
Alert on queue depth early.
Document escalation paths for paging.
